We are still actively developing this open presence. The development and all the contribution to this project is governed by our [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) The best way to help us is to file issues and pull requests against our community documentation. You can also [email us](mailto:andrewl@mozillafoundation.org?Subject=Getting%20Involved) with your experience to let us know what you find exciting/dull, clear/obscure, verbose/missing or "other".
