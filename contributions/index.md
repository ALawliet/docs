## What's going on and how can I get involved?

We are still actively developing this open presence. The best way to help us is to file issues and pull requests against our community documentation. You can also [email us](mailto:andrewl@mozillafoundation.org?Subject=Getting%20Involved) with your experience to let us know what you find exciting/dull, clear/obscure, verbose/missing or "other".

For a high level picture of our vision and products, see [our ecosystem page](coral_ecosystem.md).

For a granular view of our current focus and future plans, see [the roadmap](ROADMAP.md). This is a great place to go if you're looking for a way to contribute code or documentation.  

For more details, visit our various repos and check the issues and milestones.

To get a sense of who we are and how we approach open source software, read through our [principles](/contributions/PRINCIPLES.md), [branching and tagging strategy](/contributions/BRANCHES-AND-TAGS.md), [coding style suggestions](CODE-STYLES.md), and [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) as well.

Also, make sure to play _at least_ three rounds of [Cards Against Community](cards) daily.
