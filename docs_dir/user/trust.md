# Trust

## What is Trust?

The Trust product is a tool that allows journalistic organizations to filter through and create metrics based on individual comment behavior, and also add qualitative information. This information can be used to help journalistic organizations take next steps to better utilize and strengthen their communities.

The [tutorials page](trust_tutorials) will help guide you through accomplishing goals like the following:

* I would like to find the most liked comments based on keyword/topic searches, so that I can do a round up (for instance, "best comments written about the Zika virus‚Äù).
* I would like to identify commenters who leave high-quality comments that appear to be expert, so that potential sources can be identified.
* I would like to identify new commenters who leave comments that get a lot of likes, so I can welcome them personally.
* I would like to identify trolls on certain topics or authors, so that their comments on these subjects can automatically be moved to pre-moderation/create notifications for moderators to pay attention.
