# Introduction

Welcome! This is the place to be if you want to learn more about Coral as a user. We'll guide you through the different products and show you tutorials on how to make the best use of the tools.

Can you think of some tutorial or how-to guide that we're missing? We'd love for you to create and share it! You can read more about contributing to our documentation in our [Contribute section](../contribute/).

If you are looking for information on how to install Coral, check out the [Developer Guide](../developer) section.

## How the User Guide section is organized

We have a User Guide for each Coral product (Trust, Ask, and Talk).

* Each product has an **overview section** to tell you a little about the product, the goals for that product, and a high level explanation of its functionality.
* Each product also has a set of **tutorials**, to show you how you can perform certain tasks using that product.
