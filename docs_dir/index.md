Welcome to the Coral Project documentation! This site aims to familiarize you with the Coral Project, how it works, and how you can help.

# What is the Coral Project?

The Coral Project is an open source project to help publishers of all sizes build better communities around their journalism. We're creating tools that allow everyone feel safe, respected, and heard. It consists of [four products](#coral-products): [Ask](#ask), [Trust](#trust), [Talk](#talk), and [Guides](#guides).

If you'd like to learn more about the Coral Project from a high-level perspective, [the main Coral Project website](https://www.coralproject.net) is the best place to do that. You can find information there about the project, our goals, and the individual products.

# How the documentation is organized

The documentation is organized into sections based on what you want to do with Coral.

* The [Developer Guide](developer) section contains information geared towards a technical audience: those who want to install Coral, those who want to learn about how the various components of Coral fit together,
* The [User Guide](user_guide) section contains information geared towards a less-technical audience. It has overviews and tutorials for those who want to use the Coral products like Trust, Ask, and Talk. If you're a publisher, moderator, journalist, or reader who wants to learn how to use Coral, this section is for you.
* The [Contribute](contribute) section contains information for those who want to contribute to the Coral Project. You don't have to be a developer to contribute! There are a number of ways you can help out, which are outlined on the [Introduction](contribute) page.
