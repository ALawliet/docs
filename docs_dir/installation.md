# Installation

There are a few different installation options to choose from. Which one is right for you?

* Install a fully functioning single-server Coral Ecosystem, using Docker. This is a quick, easy, packaged solution that requires few steps and should get all components up and running quickly. The downside is that this may not scale well, as everything is installed on one server. After a certain number of users (XXX?), the server will become overloaded.
_Probably best for you if:_
* Installing each component individually, using Docker. This will install each component on a separate server, which allows for scaling up in future. It does require some more work to get each component talking and interacting with each other, but will scale better.
_Probably best for you if:_
* Installing each component individually from Go source code.
