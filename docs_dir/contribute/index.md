# Contributing to the Coral Project

Welcome! We're delighted to have you contribute to the Coral Project. Before you get started, be sure to review our [Code of Conduct](../CODE-OF-CONDUCT), which governs all development and project contributions.

There are a number of ways that you can contribute to the Coral Project: you don't have to be a developer to help out.

## Contributing without programming

We need help with a number of non-programming tasks:

* [Report bugs](reporting_bugs.md)
* [Request features](reporting_bugs#request-features)
* [Write and edit documentation](documentation/writing_documentation.md)

## Contributing by coding

If you are a developer, especially if you know Golang or Node.js, we would love your help in fixing bugs and developing new features and plug-ins.



* [Write code](development/writing_code.md)
