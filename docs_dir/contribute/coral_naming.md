# Coral naming

Are you curious about why we've named things the way that we have? As you may have guessed, each component of Coral is named after a different type of coral.

### Cay

Cay is our front-end app, which makes sense because a cay is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cay

### Elkhorn

Elkhorn coral is a coral species that builds large branches. These branches create habitats for other species.

This makse sense because Elkhorn is an form composer and embeddable builder: it, too, creates habitats for other species to come into the Coral ecosystem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkhorn_coral

### Pillar

Pillar coral is a digitate coral, which means it resembles fingers or pillars rising up.

### Sponge

Sponge is a porous organism that water can circulate through (and where it can then filter out food particles as the water circulates through). In the same way, the Sponge component of Coral takes in data and extracts it before passing it along.

### Xenia

Xenia is a soft marine coral with "arms" and "hands" that can pulse or push water around.
