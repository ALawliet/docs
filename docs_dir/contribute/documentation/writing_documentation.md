# Writing Documentation

This section explains how the community can contribute to the Coral Project documentation.

You can contribute to the documentation by editing existing documents for clarity or correcting errors. Additionally, any new features or changes to the software should be thoroughly documented. We value clear, consistent, thorough, readable documentation!

Here is how our documentation works:

* The source documentation lives in GitHub at [https://github.com/coralproject/docs/](https://github.com/coralproject/docs/).
* The documentation is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* The documentation is built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), a Markdown-based static site generator (geared towards building project documentation).
* The document is deployed using a simple Mkdocs command that builds the documentation and deploys it to GitHub pages.

## Getting the documentation

All of the documentation for the Coral Project [resides in GitHub](https://github.com/coralproject/docs) in the "docs" repository.

To get a local version of the documentation, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/coralproject/docs.git
```

If you haven't worked with Git before, you can find [instructions on downloading it here](TODO).

## Getting started with MkDocs

The Coral Project's documentation uses the [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation system, which uses Markdown to format text. The [MkDocs website](http://www.mkdocs.org/) contains a lot of good information on writing documentation in MkDocs, and there are plenty of decent Markdown cheatsheets floating around, [like this one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## How the documentation is organized

The documentation is organized into several categories:

* **Introduction**: This offers a general overview of the Coral Project and its different components.
* **Developer Guide**: This provides information for technical users of the Coral Project. It offers installation instructions for the Coral Ecosystem as a whole, as well as installation instructions for each individual component.
* **User Guide**: This provides information for end users (publishers, journalists, moderators, readers) on how to use the features of Coral. It includes tutorials and how-to guides.
* **Contribute**: This provides information on how to contribute to the Coral Project through open source. There are sections for the developers (how to work with GitHub, etc.), as well as sections for those who want to contribute to other pieces of the Coral Project (such as the documentation!).
* **FAQ**
