# Writing Documentation

This section explains how the community can contribute to the Coral Project documentation.

You can contribute to the documentation by editing existing documents for clarity or correcting errors. Additionally, any new features or changes to the software should be thoroughly documented.

Here is, briefly, how our documentation works:

* The source documentation lives in GitHub at [https://github.com/coralproject/docs/](https://github.com/coralproject/docs/).
* The documentation is built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), a Markdown-based static site generator (geared towards building project documentation).
* The document is deployed using a simple Mkdocs command that builds the documentation, and then the resulting generated site is pushed.

## Style Guide

There is a separate page for the [documentation style guide](docs_style_guide), that covers guidelines for how to organize and write instructions and tutorials, how to format text for consistency, and terminology.

## Installing MkDocs

The Coral Project's documentation uses the [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation system, which uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to format text. Before you can get started on writing and editing the documentation, you will need to have MkDocs installed.

You can [download and install MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation) using the instructions on their website. The [MkDocs website](http://www.mkdocs.org/) also contains a lot of good information on writing documentation in MkDocs, and there are plenty of decent Markdown cheatsheets floating around, [like this one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Getting the documentation

All of the documentation for the Coral Project [resides in GitHub](https://github.com/coralproject/docs) in the `docs` repository.

To get a local version of the documentation, clone the repository using this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/coralproject/docs.git
```

You now have a local copy of the documentation on your local machine, that you can modify and add to.

**Note**: If you already have a local copy of the documentation repository on your computer, be sure to perform a `git pull` before you start editing. This will ensure that you are working on the most recent available version of the documentation, which will prevent potential merge conflicts when you're ready to commit your changes.

## Writing and editing the documentation

The documents you'll be editing are the .md Markdown files located in the `docs_dir` directory. **DO NOT edit the files in the `site` directory.** Those files are the static HTML files generated by MkDocs and pushed to Heroku. If you edit the static HTML files, those changes won't get saved to the Markdown files.

As you are writing and editing the documentation, refer to the [Documentation Style Guide](docs_style_guide) to make sure you are remaining consistent with our current documentation standards, and writing the best and clearest documentation possible.
