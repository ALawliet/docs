# Writing Code

So youâ€™d like to write some code to improve the Coral Project? Great!

- Bug fixing
- New features
- Plugins


## Before you begin

Before writing any code with the intention of merging into master, ensure the work you're doing has an GitHub issue and try in good faith to engage the community in conversation in the issue feed. Here is a checklist to follow before starting:

* Check the FAQ to see if your issue has already been addressed.
* Check the GitHub issues to see if an issue already exists for the work you want to do, and to make sure that there isn't already someone working on it.
    * If there isn't already someone working on it, then leave a comment to let everyone know that you are starting work on it.
    * If someone is already working on it, consider collaborating with them.
* If no issue exists, then create an issue for it before getting started. You can find more information on writing a detailed issue [here](../reporting_bugs.md).
