# Trust

## What is Trust?

Trust allows newsrooms to see how people behave in their community, to build simple formulas that find helpful and difficult community members across a range of different contexts, and create APIs to aid moderation and other actions.

We have a working prototype of Trust - [contact us](https://coralproject.net/contact.html) if you'd like to see it. 

Trust is currently being built inside of [Talk](https://coralproject.net/products/talk.html).
