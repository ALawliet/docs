# Ask


## Why Use Ask?
Ask helps you create embeddable forms quickly, manage the submissions you receive, and easily create a gallery of the best responses to share with your readers. Also, because Ask is intalled on your servers your organization will own the data.

## Creating A Form

Surveys and forms are powerful tools when trying to engage your audience. Before you make your form, think about what you’re asking and why. We have [an article on our blog](https://blog.coralproject.net/forms-audience-engagement/) that will help you write better forms. 

### Getting Started

![Form-builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/losowsky/docs/master/docs_dir/images/formbuilder1.gif) 

#### Form Name

To get started, give your form a name. This form name will only be used internally and will help you search and identify it among the other forms you and your organization have created. We recommend using unique descriptive form names to make searching for your forms later on as easy as possible.

#### Headline & Description

With each Ask form you have the option create a headline and subheadline that will be displayed above your form. Use a headline to grab your readers' attention, and take advantage of the subheadline to give instructions or provide an additional description. *This step is optional.*

#### Previewing and Saving Your Form

As you begin creating your form we encourage you to save early and save often (we will be adding auto-save in the future) by clicking "Save." Also, you can preview your form by clicking the "Preview" button.

### Building Your Form

#### Adding Questions

![Form-builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/losowsky/docs/master/docs_dir/images/formbuilder2.gif) 

To add a question, simply click on a question type located in the left panel or drag and drop that question into the form builder. You can rearrange questions by dragging a question by its number and dropping it into the correct location, or by using the up and down action buttons on a question.

#### Question Types

Ask offers 7 question types to choose from, giving your readers a variety of ways to answer and share their stories.
- **Short Answer**: Ideal for short answers such as a name, city, favorite dog breed, etc. This will give your readers a single line text input area for their response. You have the option to set a character limit (or minimum) for this question type.
- **Long Answer**: Use this question type for more open-ended questions that may result in reponses of a few sentences or paragraphs. You can also enable minimum and maximum character limits for this question type.
- **Numbers**: Fairly self explanitory, use this when you are asking for an answer that is a numerical value. (If you are looking for readers to submit their phone numbers for follow up, we have a separate question type for that!)
- **Multiple Choice**: Give your readers a few answers to choose from. You can also enable, an "other" option to let them provide their answer.
- **Email**: Looking to potentially follow up with some of your readers? Ask for their email address with this field. 
- **Date**: You can use this field to verify an age minimum. Readers will be able to choose the date with a calendar picker or by entering the date manually. 
- **Phone Number**: Make it easy to follow up by phone. This field is designated as ["Reader Info"]() by default.

#### Creating your question
- **Write your question:** After you add a question type from the left, you can type your question for your readers in the first text field. 
- **Instructions:** You can use this field to provide an additional explanation for the question or provide example responses to help give your readers an idea of what type of answer you are looking for. *This is optional*

#### Question Options
- **Required:** If a question is very important you may want to make it required. You can make any question required by clicking the checkbox in the expanded question.

- **Reader Info:** One key feature of Ask is the ability to designate certain questions as personal information, connecting contributions to your users’ existing on-site identity. Enabling a question as "Reader Info" also makes it easier for you to connect a response to it's author when [creating your gallery]().

#### Reordering, Duplicating and Deleting Questions

![Form-builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/losowsky/docs/master/docs_dir/images/formbuilder3.gif) 

**Reording** a question can be done by either dragging and dropping a question by it's number to correct position, or by using the up and down arrows on the question's action bar.

You may **delete** a question by clicking the `icon needed` or **duplicate** a question by clicking the `icon needed`.

#### Saying thank you

After readers submit a response, they will receive a confirmation message thanking them for their time. With Ask you can easily customize this meesage to fit with your organizations style and voice.

#### Linking your privacy policy
Using Markdown, you can add a link to your organizations privacy policy. This link will prominantly appear above the "Submit" button on the form.
