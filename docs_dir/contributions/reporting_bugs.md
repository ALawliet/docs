# Reporting bugs and requesting features

Before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, please consider these general points:

 * Check that someone hasn’t already filed the bug or feature request by searching the "Issues" for the repo in question.
 * Don’t reopen issues that have been marked “wontfix” by a core developer. This mark means that the decision has been made that we can’t or won’t fix this particular issue.
 
## Reporting bugs

Complete, reproducible, specific bug reports are very helpful. When writing a bug report, be sure to include the following:

 * A clear, concise description of the problem.
 * A set of instructions for replicating it. 
 
Add as much additional debug information as you can, such as: code snippets, test cases, exception backtraces, screenshots, etc. A nice small test case is the best way to report a bug, as it gives us an easy way to confirm the bug quickly.

## Reporting user interface bugs and features

If your bug or feature request touches on anything visual in nature, there are a few additional guidelines to follow:

 * Include screenshots in your ticket which are the visual equivalent of a minimal testcase.
 * If the issue is difficult to show off using a still image, consider capturing a brief screencast. If possible, capture only the relevant area of the screen.
 
## Requesting features

Here are some tips on how to make a request most effectively:

 * Describe clearly and concisely what the missing feature is and how you’d like to see it implemented. Include example code (non-functional is OK) if possible.
 * Explain why you’d like the feature. In some cases this is obvious, but an explanation can help determine why and how the feature will be useful.
