# Xenia

[Xenia](https://github.com/coralproject/xenia) is a configurable service layer that publishes endpoints against mongo aggregation pipeline queries.

## Concepts and Motivations

### Composition

Aggregation pipelines are _chain-able_, allowing for the output of one endpoint to be fed into the next. Xenia will provide a request syntax to allow for this, giving the requesting application another dimension of flexibility via query control.

Similarly, output documents from multiple pipelines can be _bundled_ together. This is particularly useful in the no-sql/document db paradigm in which joins are not natively supported.

### Restructuring of Team Dynamics

Xenia moves 100% of the query logic out of the application code. Front end devs, data analysis, and anyone else familiar with the simple, declarative mongo aggregation syntax can alter the service behavior. This removes the requirement for back end engineering and devops expertise from the process of refining the data requests.

Xenia's CLI tools allow anyone with a basic understanding of document database concepts and aggregation pipeline syntax to create or update endpoints.  (Once the web UI is complete updates to the pipelines will be even more convenient.)
